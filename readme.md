GHOSTS ADAPTIVE AMBIENCE SYSTEM (Python Version)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install, run setup.py, this will install the required python libraries if they don't exist already, and it will then pull the system assets from my website and unpack them.

If you've ran setup in this enviroment before, and just need to unpack the assets, run unpack.py

The "assets" I speak of are audio files. These are used for ambience generation.
